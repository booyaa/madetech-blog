# Pair Programming

We've recently become huge advocates of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) at Made, the practice of having two developers sit at one keyboard, with one at the keyboard (the "driver") and one observing. The driver types out the code, whilst the observer constantly reviews what is being typed. These roles are then constantly switched throughout the session.

When pair programming, you'll either be peers of a similar skill level who can pick up after one another as though they were handing the baton over in a relay race, or a teacher/student combo where the focus is on educating the student on the job.

It's been hugely beneficial for us, both in terms of helping us pass knowledge on when we work side by side with clients during the development process, as well as internally, where it keeps us extremely focused on the task at hand and helps us bring new employees quickly up to speed.

## Communication is key

Whether the two of you are of a similar skill level, or you're a teacher/student pair, it is absolutely essential that the person in the driving seat makes sure they're verbalising what they're currently doing or thinking. Doing so gives the other person a window into your thought process through which they can then begin to contribute, to ask questions and make suggestions.

## Regularly switch drivers

Particularly when there's a looming deadline, in the teacher/student scenario there can be a temptation to let the teacher do all the work and fly through the code without the student really having a chance to absorb what's happening.

The idea of pair programming is as much about knowledge sharing as it is that old adage "two heads are better than one", so while progress might be a little slower for the teacher, the students skill level rises that much quicker for having a mentor to ask questions of as they go, which is beneficial to everyone in the long run.

With that in mind, you should be making a point of switching which of you is in the driving seat at set intervals. There are a million and one pomodoro apps that are perfect for exactly this purpose, download one, set it to a reasonable interval, say 15 or 20 minutes, and then start working. When it hits zero, switch seats and repeat. You'll find that the momentum you generate this way can lead to massive gains in productivity, especially when the two of you are at a similar skill level, in which case a certain level of competitiveness arises as you egg each other on to the finish line.

## It's not a silver bullet

In some situations, a solution to a given problem might not be apparent to either of you, and it can seem that putting your thought processes into words at times like these wastes effort you could be putting into figuring out the problem. This time could be better spent with your partner working on something else whilst you concentrate on formulating the solution. Take the opportunity to go your separate ways for a while, and regroup when you have solid idea you can explain to your partner.

It also doesn't necessarily mean development on a task is faster. Quite often, two developers will be able to tear through a task in no time, but in the teacher/student scenario the teacher may need to slow down out of necessity to allow the student to digest what is being produced, and even peers may find a two hour task balloons into a four hour task, at which point eight man hours have been spent.

As mentioned, we've found pair programming to extremely beneficial and even a lot of fun - it's a great way to educate, share knowledge, and team build, all whilst focusing on the current project, and we would implore everyone to at least try it out.
