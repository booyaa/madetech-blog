# Homeless Hackday London

At Made Tech, we run an internal Hack Day or Learning Day every month. We take time off our paid work to focus on learning something new (like a new programming language) or to hack together some tools that solve a problem we're encountering. 

Some of our recent hack days have covered:

* Learning Kotlin
* Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture
* Creating a Smart Office
* Hardening Security
* Making Computer Games
* Creating Dashboards / Information Radiators 

Historically these days have been internally facing, with someone pitching an idea and just our team in attendance. This month we decided to try an alternate format, we used the time allocated to attend a public hack day called Homeless Hack. 

I thought I'd share some of the thinking behind this and take you through what we created at the hack. Hopefully this will inspire some other organisations to follow suit and use hack days for good!

#### Default to open
We have always tried to be an open company and things like publishing our [company handbook](https://github.com/madetech/handbook), [frequently blogging](https://www.madetech.com/blog), [mentoring new programmers](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/master/roles/engineer.md#mentor) or [writing books](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-High-Performance-Agile-Teams/dp/1544972687) were steps towards us being more open. It felt at odds with our culture to run hack days that were closed events, when so much of what we do is open.  

#### Be a socially responsible SME
Historically we've never given much thought to things like Corporate Social Responsibility. We're an SME, we've got less than 30 people working for us and we like to think we run the business ethically and fairly. 

It's always felt like the world of CSR didn't really apply to us. e.g. It's for the big enterprises, who do bad things and need to offset the bad things by doing some good things. 

This was a good opportunity course correct our thinking and invest some time into something that would do social good. 

#### Building awareness
One of our company objectives this year is to build awareness of Made Tech within the UK public sector. Events like this help us to work towards this and 

#### Improve our skills / others skills

#### What about the costs?
Obviously  of the things it will have cost us ~Â£4,800 in lost opportunity costs as our billings will be down. However, this 

A small contingent from Made Tech (~7 people) left the office on Frida Homeless Hackday over the last few days. 


## Day 1 - Learn
We kicked off Homeless Hack on Friday morning with talks by X, Y & Z. These talks really helped to set the scene and get a deeper understanding of the problem. As someeboy

## Day 2 - We're Live


## What's Next
It looks like Homeless Hack is gaining some momentum. I've already seen Homeless Hack events organised and happen in Leeds, Manchester and Oxford. It's great to see the work continuing. As a company, we're discussing the next Hack Day that we're going to attend and what we can do to get a higher staff turn out. 

Finally, a huge thank you to Janet Hughes, James Cattell, Gia Marcus & Richard Barton. They organised the London event and made it a fantastic success. These type of events wouldn't happen without their hard work, so top work to them all.
