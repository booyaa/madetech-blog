    ### What’s your background in software engineering?

    **Tasmin:** I learnt to program during my Masters degree in Computer Science. As part of the course I did a Software Engineering unit - we worked in teams to make a game. I really enjoyed this unit, so for my dissertation I decided to develop a web application for sports teams. The dissertation was challenging at first, but it gave me good insight into software engineering and really improved my programming skills.

    **Dan:** Within education - Computing A level and Computer Science at universtity. Taught myself basic programming/sysops stuff in my spare time, but learnt things in more detail through university and my placement.

    Outside of education I've done minor freelance work setting up a website using a CMS, and I did a year's placement at a cloud accounting software company as a developer. I was in charge of their CI (Jenkins), ensuring it ran smoothy, and I worked on multiple projects during my year there.

    On my placement I learned a lot about TDD, Clean Architecture, Continuous Development/Integration, feature toggles, agile/kanban.

    ### How did you first hear about The Academy?

    **Dan:** A former colleague began working here, and he recommended the job for me as he believed it would be a good fit.

    **Tasmin:** I heard about the Academy at my university Career Fair. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering and talking to Luke at the fair gave me a great insight into what working at Made Tech was like!

    ### Can you tell us a bit about the project you’re working on?

    **Dan:** We're creating a statistics dashboard for the directors at Made Tech, in order to help visualise their goals and their progress towards achieving them.

    **Tasmin:** The dashboard will contain current data on Made Tech Marketing, Sales and Support. I’m really enjoying this project as it's giving me a chance to learn more about software engineering and develop my Ruby skills.

    ### How are you finding working at Made Tech?

    **Dan:** Enjoying it! I find that the team and environment is very supportive, and is a great environment to learn more about software engineering and professional development.

    **Tasmin:** Working at Made Tech is great! I particularly like being part of the Academy, as it's giving me a strong grounding in software engineering (and Ryan is a great mentor). Everyone here is always willing to help each other out and there’s a strong focus on giving each other feedback and personal development.
