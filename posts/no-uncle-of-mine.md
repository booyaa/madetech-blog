# No Uncle of Mine

Last month, one topic sparked a lot of debate on the internet in general, and in
the Tech industry in particular: the so called "Manifesto", writen by James
Damore, then engineer at Google. While this blog post won't be about the
manifesto, some events that occured after it came out prompted me to write this.
But before looking into it, let's go over some of what has beeen said and
written since last month.

## Googlebro's Manifesto and subsequent firing.

In case you've missed it, you can find the original manifesto [here (PDF)](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf).
That piece of writing has definetely received more attention than it deserves,
to the point of even having a lengthy [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_Ideological_Echo_Chamber).
Since it became public,  many have discussed this in more detail than I'll be
able to do here, so to keep this short, here are some interesting reading on the
subject.

- The manifesto relies on evolutionary psychology, which as field is at least
  [debatable](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/08/evolutionary_psychology_is_the_most_obvious_example_of_how_science_is_flawed.html).
- Even some scientists from that field [raise questions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/10/a-scientists-take-on-the-biological-claims-from-the-infamous-google-anti-diversity-manifesto)
  on Damore's take.
- The manifesto _does_ show [sexism](https://medium.com/@adljksbvkj/heres-your-point-by-point-refutation-of-the-google-memo-b7201d0cca04).
- And my personal favorite: Sharing such a document to the whole company turned
  the author into someone people could no longer [work with](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788).

## Teaching and punishing

Now, amongst the multitude of blog posts, news articles, and tweets that
followed the release of the memo, one influential person within the software
industry, let's call him Stan, came out with his take on the matter. Well,
actually, Stan did not focus on the content of the memo, which he aknowledge was
wrong, but instead focused on Google's decision to fire Googlebro. According to
him :

> You never punish bad ideas.
> Instead, you counter bad ideas with better ideas.

And as such, not only was the firing a wrong decision, but it would in turn make
people unconfortable sharing their ideas, which would endanger a company as
Google that relies on innovation.

While I agree that you should try to discuss things freely, and allow people and
their ideas to evolve though debate, there is a limit to how far this can go on
for. In this particular context, it seems like Google did provide
opportunities both for discussion and learning, as is mentionned in the
manifesto itself. If even after this, someone continues pushing on a subject
with a rhetoric that hurts the company and its employees, I don't see any other
path other than the dismissal of the offender.

Furthermore, it is important indeed that people feel like they can share their
ideas freely. So this raises the question, what should a company do when one of
its employees says half of his coworkers are less suited for the job than him?
History suggests that letting this kind of thinking foster inside a company
could make the people targetted by that memo less confident in themselves and
hence less prone to share their thoughts.

Finally, while a company like Google does rely on innovation to continue its
business, there is nothing new in that manifesto. The points Damore made were
old ones, and you would be excused for hoping these would be considered defeated
in the 21st century.

## The dangers of missing the point

Some things are not okay to say, especially in an industry such as ours where
white men are over represented. Thus the need for our community, in particular
its more privileged members, to stand up and denounce points of view such as the
one expressed by Damore. Failure in doing so will continue to make this community
unwelcoming for under representended folks.

This is why Stan's stance was probably the most toxic thing a prominent white
men in the community could have said. As such Stan should stop complaining
about the quality of the feedback he received, and instead start asking himself
some questions as to why people sent him mostly aggressive or condescending
tweets.

Part of the issue also is that Stan has a pretty poor track record when it comes
to talking about women in tech, and one of his following posts sheds some light
into why that is. While he has recognized and publicly apologized for some
misplaced humour in the past, he seems very unapologetic about this current
issue.

## Greater than code

When trying to wrap my head around this, I realized something about Stan. One
of the reasons he is so important in the software industry is because of his
thoughts on the way we work. One thing that nows strikes me is how much emphasis
he puts on professional skills. While this emphasis has many values, bore many
fruits, and has an historical reason to come into existence, I start feeling
like their importance should become second class in the modern software
industry. More and more, the challenges we face are about people, making teams
efficient, and delighting users and customers. Those challenges are the ones
that actually deliver value, but are by nature greater than just code.

The craftsman analogy may have been good, but as with any analogy it reaches a
point where it starts to become thin, and others may have to be devised. Those
are definetly interesting times with interesting challenges to be solved as the
software community continues to evolve and to mature. One possibility could be
to stop focusing on Clean Code, but start thinking about [Livable Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDp6eDCi1Vo)
