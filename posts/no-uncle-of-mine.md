# No Uncle of Mine

Last month, one topic sparked a lot of debate on the internet in general, and in
the Tech industry in particular: the so called "Manifesto", written by James
Damore, then engineer at Google. While this blog post won't be about the
manifesto, some events that occurred after it came out prompted me to write this.
But before looking into it, let's go over some of what has been said and
written since last month.

## Damore's Manifesto and subsequent firing.

In case you've missed it, here is link to the [original manifesto (PDF)](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf).
That piece of writing has definitely received more attention than it deserves,
to the point of even having a lengthy [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_Ideological_Echo_Chamber).
Since it became public,  many have discussed this in more detail than I'll be
able to do here, so to keep this short, here is some interesting reading on the
subject.

- The manifesto relies on evolutionary psychology, which as field is at least
  [debatable](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/08/evolutionary_psychology_is_the_most_obvious_example_of_how_science_is_flawed.html).
- Even some scientists from that field [raise questions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/10/a-scientists-take-on-the-biological-claims-from-the-infamous-google-anti-diversity-manifesto)
  on Damore's take.
- The manifesto _does_ show [sexism](https://medium.com/@adljksbvkj/heres-your-point-by-point-refutation-of-the-google-memo-b7201d0cca04).
- And my personal favorite: Sharing such a document to the whole company turned
  the author into someone people could no longer [work with](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788).

## Teaching and punishing

Now, amongst the multitude of blog posts, news articles, and tweets that
followed the release of the memo, one influential person within the software
industry, Robert C. Martin, came out with [his take](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/09/ThoughtPolice.html)
on the matter. Well, actually, Robert did not focus on the content of the memo,
which he acknowledged  was wrong, but instead focused on Google's decision to
fire Damore. According to him :

> You never punish bad ideas.
> Instead, you counter bad ideas with better ideas.

And as such, not only was the firing a wrong decision, but it would in turn make
people uncomfortable sharing their ideas, which would endanger a company as
Google that relies on innovation.

While I agree that you should try to discuss things freely, and allow people and
their ideas to evolve through debate, there surely is a limit on how much time
and effort a company can invest into the debating process. In this particular
case, it seems like Google _did_ provide opportunities both for discussion and
learning, as is mentioned in the manifesto itself. If after this, someone
continues pushing on a subject with a rhetoric that hurts the company and its
employees, surely the company can be forgiven for drawing a line, and cutting
its ties to that person.

Furthermore, it is indeed important that people feel like they can share their
ideas freely. But this raises the question : what should a company do when one of
its employees says half of his coworkers are less suited for the job than him?
If anything, letting this kind of thinking foster inside a company would make the
people targeted by that memo less confident in themselves and hence less prone
to share their thoughts. And while freedom of speech is important, one should
try to remember that :

> The exercise of the natural rights of each [person] has only those borders which assure other members of the society the enjoyment of these same rights.

Finally, while a company like Google does rely on innovation to continue its
business, there was nothing new in that manifesto. The points Damore made were
old ones, and you would be excused for hoping these would be considered defeated
in the 21st century.

## The dangers of missing the point

In an industry where heterosexual cisgender white men are over represented, I
strongly believe we could be doing a better job of denouncing, refuting, and
standing up against points of view and behaviours that make our industry less
inclusive or less welcoming to members of under represented groups. And no, the
issue of diversity cannot be reduced to a [pipeline problem](http://www.kaporcenter.org/tech-leavers/).

Obviously this is a personal belief, and I could not reasonably expect Robert to
act accordingly. But what worries me, is that I find there is something toxic in
Robert's take, that he failed to perceive, and that I believe could help him make
sense of the sheer  amount of [negative feedback](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/10/OnTheInabilityToDiscussThingsRationally.html)
he received : he missed the point.

Putting aside the tone of his original article, which could be seen as
inappropriate to the situation, but was truthful to his style of communication,
his focus was to try to make a seemingly reasonable point on an adjacent topic.
As someone coming from what others will perceive as a position of privilege, his
attempt to address the situation in a "moderate" manner brings to mind the image
of a man in more sinister times who

> [...] prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.

Furthermore, no "thought police" was involved in the incident. The Ex-Googler
did not get _arrested_ because of what he _thought_, he was _fired_ for probably
many reasons including what he _wrote_ and the subsequent publicity of that
Manifesto. Giving an article the title "The Thought Police" makes it sound like
its author believes persecution was at play, which would make Damore a victim.
In turn, this starts to resemble [Reverse Victimization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/annette-gross/the-new-outbreak-of-rever_b_8726140.html), 
which is something that clearly appears in the Manifesto itself.

## Greater than code

When trying to articulate my personal thoughts around what disturbed me in
Robert's article, I also started to perceive something else about him.

His importance in the software industry is largely due to the many and great
contributions he made to what we call Software Engineering today. He has spent a
considerable amount of time and energy sharing his thoughts on how we write
software that delivers value, that can be depended upon, and that can adapt to
change. But his focus revolves primarily around personal skills, and while there
is definitely value, in honing one's skills -- or as Robert would say, one's
craft, this is only part of our jobs. In order to deliver software, we need a
team whose collective output is more than just the contribution of each member.

This is a social challenge, not a technical one. Some simple examples include :

 - Knowledge has to be shared amongst the team to prevent silos and to increase
   the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).
 - According to [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law),
   we need good communication structures inside an organization to produce well
   designed systems.
 - Diverse teams are more [efficient and innovative](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter).

As such, so called "soft skills", such as Communication, Creativity and
Collaboration, could arguably be seen as more valuable to a company. Especially
since technical abilities can be taught, whereas the previous ones are harder to
develop.

In conclusion, I realize I should not be surprised by, what is for me, Robert's
"faux-pas". As [he recognizes himself](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/14/WomenInTech.html), 
such topics are not his strong suit. Personally, while I'll certainly continue
to try and improve myself on the technical side thanks to his work and [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU),
I will also be de-emphasizing Clean Code in favor of more [Livable Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDp6eDCi1Vo).
