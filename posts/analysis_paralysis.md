# Analysis Paralysis - How to kick off new initiatives in slow moving enterprise organisations.

So you are trying to build a fast moving digital organisation, one which responds to market opportunity, is decisive and can get things delivered. One of the challenges you may encounter is a thing we call Analysis Paralysis.

It's a problem that is prevalent in large enterprises and governments, where lack of trust, politics and departmental / regional siloing can cause over-analysis, leading to indecision, resulting in things grinding to a halt.

We see the most significant Analysis Paralysis occurring in the time that elapses between somebody trying to boot up a new initiative (Hey, we should do X!) and actually cutting the first line of code and making some progress.

People working within organisations that face this problem often come up reasons to justify the lack of progress e.g "We need to get Enterprise Architects involved and they are too busy at the moment", "The business people haven't made a decision yet", "We've got a meeting in four weeks to discuss it further. That's the earliest all stakeholders could do" etc.

These sorts of excuses don't sit well with us, as in most scenarios, when chunked properly, we believe any organisation can go from having an idea to having something in production within a few weeks.

So why does this problem exist in pretty much every big organisation we have seen? Why can some people in these organisations facilitate progress, whilst others cannot?

We believe it comes down to a few things:

1. **Delivery** - The team at GOV.UK came up with the phrase "The Strategy Is Delivery" and this succinctly sums up our views. Get something shipped, very little matters until then.

2. **Knowledge** - Truly understand how to take sensible chunks of work. Get the deliver team involved from Day 1, if you do not know how to do this.

## Lean Inception

One of the techniques we've used to help businesses get through Analysis Paralysis is to use a Lean Inception. This approach is useful when there is uncertainty within the business about how to move things forward.

Although the term is often misunderstood, the central property of an MVP is that it is something we build in order to learn whether it is worthwhile to continue building a product. So we choose features based on testing our assumptions of what is valuable to our users. For this we need to understand who our users are, what activity they do that the product supports and how to measure if they find the product useful.
