# Red Hat Forum London: Agile Cloud Migration with Ansible

We're excited to announce that our very own Luke Morton is going to be giving a talk at this year's [Red Hat Forum London](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/events/red-hat-forum-united-kingdom-2017), on October 3rd.

Entitled "Agile Cloud Migration with Ansible", Luke will be discussing our experiences using Ansible to perform cloud migrations in an agile way. Organisations of all sizes are finding themselves faced with the considerable challenge of migrating a number of legacy applications to the cloud, and often with a lack of migration experience.

We've found that the answer lies in not treating a migration as a single, monolithic and risky task. By taking a number of smaller steps and prioritising the elements that need to be moved to the cloud, we've been able to reduce risk and build both confidence and experience within organisations that are trying to make such a change.

If you'd like to hear more and throw some questions his way, Luke will be giving the talk **at 13:45 in the Pepys Suite**, as part of the Specialist Breakout sessions taking place on the day.
