# Vim Considered Harmful

Oh no, not another Vim article.

No I don't use Emacs and I don't hate Vim.
This title is purposefully meant to envoke some angry emotions in people using Vim or considering moving to it.

I've been using vim for around 7 years, and I still use it now.

There is a twist to this story.

The title may be on the click baity side but I believe that it's 100% accurate.

Vim can be harmful in some situations.

## I fell in love with the act of creating code
When I was studying, some of my first programming was done in Actionscript on Windows PC's.

## I tried to convert everyone in my company to use Vim

## I was slow
My obsession with a customised development environment grew to the point where I was using Arch Linux at work with Xmonad installed and no real
graphical interface.

## How many balls can you really juggle at once?
If you haven't seen Rich Hickeys talk titled 'Simple Made Easy', I would highly recommend that you watch it.
In it he touches on the capacity that programmers have in solving problems.  He compares it to juggling where even the best juggler in the world can
only juggle a certain amount of balls before it becomes impossible.

## So what can you do?
Unfortunately Vim is not a text editor that you can have a part time relationship with. It's all or nothing.  If you believe that using the arrow keys
or mouse is wrong and this adds mental overhead, then what exactly is the point?

## Typing isn't the bottleneck
Typing isn't the bottleneck but if it steals your cognitive capabilities, then you have made it the bottleneck.

## Pragmatism is stylish
I hate the word pragmatism.  I've heard it thrown around so many times and truly it's quite soggy.

## What now?
Should I stop using Vim then? Should I surrender to a more user friendly text editor?
Most certainly not.  I would never go back to using a point and click style editor.

What you need to do is to sit down and study Vim until the speedy commands are burned into your muscle memory.

One of the best resources I have found online is Vimgolf.  I must have completed over a 100 challenges.
