# Vim Considered Harmful

Oh no, not another Vim article.

No I don't use Emacs and no, I don't hate Vim.
This title is purposefully meant to envoke angry emotions amongst Vim users or people aiming to switch to Vim in order to convey what I think is an
important message that I wish I knew a long time ago.

I've been using vim for around 7 years, and I still use it now.

There is a twist to this story.

The title may be on the click baity side but I believe that it's 100% accurate.

Vim can be harmful in certain situations.

There is no denying that Vim is a powertool, and as with any power tool, they command respect.

## I fell in love with the act of creating code

When I was studying, some of my first programming was done in Actionscript on Windows PC's.
My teammate was fast when it came to typing, and modifying the code.

He used Alt-Tab to switch between programs and I enjoyed watching him craft the programs we were working on.

I tried to emulate him, and I would switch between programs using Alt-Tab until I started getting RSI.

This was mainly because my posture wasn't correct but that's beyond the point.

I actually enjoyed the process of physically creating the code, and found that everyone has a unique style.

I became obsessed and lost focus on what actually matters.

## I tried to convert everyone in my company to use Vim

The first time I heard of Vim, I couldn't understand what all the hype was about.

As with so many things, after you hear about it for the first time, it seems to just pops up everywhere.

I heard that only the best programmers could use Vim and that you could be so much faster in it, ultimately making you a better *programmer*.

## I was slow

My obsession with a customised development environment grew to the point where I was typing in Colemak on Arch Linux at work with Xmonad and no real graphical interface.  To interact with the database, I would do it through Vim, obviously.

Half the applications on my computer didn't work correctly and I refused to use anything that wasn't on the command line.

My obsession for tinkering had finally spun out of control.  Not to say that this development environment was wrong, but I didn't put in enough work
to be efficient in it.

## How many balls can you really juggle at once?

If you haven't seen Rich Hickey's talk titled 'Simple Made Easy', I would highly recommend that you watch it.

In it he touches on the capacity that programmers have in solving problems.

He compares it to juggling balls where even the best juggler in the world can only juggle a certain amount of balls before it becomes impossible.

With poorly designed programs, you might end up with a few balls unrelated to the problem that you are trying to solve.

You end up keeping things in your head, robbing you of capacity to dedicate it to other thought processes.

## Typing isn't the bottleneck
Typing isn't the bottleneck but if it steals your cognitive capabilities, then you have made it the bottleneck.

## Pragmatism is stylish
I hate the word pragmatism.  I've heard it thrown around so many times and truly it's quite soggy.

## What now?
Unfortunately Vim is not a text editor that you can have a part time relationship with.
It's all or nothing.
If you believe that using the arrow keys or mouse is wrong and this adds mental overhead, then what exactly is the point?

Should I stop using Vim then? Should I surrender to a more user friendly text editor?
Most certainly not.  I would never go back to using a point and click style editor.

What you need to do is to sit down and study Vim until the speedy commands are burned into your muscle memory.

One of the best resources I have found online is Vimgolf.  I must have completed over a 100 challenges.
