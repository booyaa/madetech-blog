#Introducing QuizBuzz!

We've been running internal [Code Dojo sessions](https://www.madetech.com/blog/the-made-code-dojo) for a couple of years now, and last year our newest member, Andrew, suggested putting a new spin on the traditional format. We enjoyed it so much that we had to share it with the wider community so, to help celebrate our move to a swanky new office, we'll be opening our doors to the public and launching Made's first monthly event: QuizBuzz!

## What is QuizBuzz!?

In the style of a pub quiz, QuizBuzz! is a chance for teams to show just how much they know about all things software related, from old school programming languages to modern video gaming, with a few pop culture curveballs thrown in for good measure.

Also, since no pub quiz is complete without a drink or two, we'll be keeping you watered and fed with beers and pizzas (with non-alcoholic and vegetarian friendly options, of course).

A game of two halves and five rounds, with myself as your quiz master, each team will need to work together to come out on top and claim victory. If trivia isn't your strong suit, then maybe, [despite what Phil Karlton says](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), naming things is! At the end of the night, our very own Seb Ashton will be handing out a prize for the best team name.

When the victors have been declared, we'll then head to the nearby Prince William Henry pub for another drink or two, where everyone will have a chance to get to know the other teams a little better.

There are limited places, so claim a spot [here on meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/QuizBuzz/events/229484828/), and we'll see you all on the night!
