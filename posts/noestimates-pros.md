# The pros of #NoEstimates in Software Delivery

In this first of a pair of articles about software project estimations, I'll be arguing in favour of foregoing estimations.

The #NoEstimates movement/hashtag has been gaining much press over the past couple of years, particularly when tied to a Kanban-style workflow. It takes the viewpoint that instead of expending effort estimating, or some may argue, guessing, as to how long the implementation of a feature may take, you're better to spend that effort delivering the feature instead.

Delivery methodologies such as Scrum are heavily underpinned by estimations. Planning sessions typically preceed the start of every iteration, during which the team will estimate the complexity involved in a set of features, cutting the features aimed for implementation in the iteration when the estimates say that the team is at capacity.


## Humans are bad at estimation

Humans are inherently bad at estimating the time it will take the complete a task. Particularly in complex domains such as software development, where it can be unrealistic to foresee fine-grained implementation detail or every case in which unexpected complexity could arise.


## Estimates used as deadlines

In many organisations, it's common practice that estimates are quickly turned in to deadlines. If a team estimates that a feature can be completed in one week, there can be an expectation that it *will* be delivered in one week.

This can lead to scenarios where teams inflate their estimates to ensure they have adequate buffer to deliver the feature to the estimate-come-deadline, ultimately reducing your team's throughput as every feature includes potentially unnecessary padding.


## You estimate when you know least

By nature, estimations happen before the work has started. You might have chosen to spike out an implementation to remove some uncertainty or to understand the feasibility of a proposed solution, but you still know least about the feature before you've written any code.



## Time can be better spent delivering value

In most scenarios, we believe that you'd be hard-pressed to argue that spending time estimating (guessing?!) is a true value adding exercise. Estimates can seldom speed up delivery, and so the time spent estimating is not time spent delivering working software.

We often espouse that generating heavy documentation, or designing interfaces using tools such as Photoshop is ultimately an exercise in producing artefacts. In many cases, producing time estimates can be viewed in the same vein.
