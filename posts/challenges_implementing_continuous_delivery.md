## Intro

## Culture/organisation isn't ready

Isn't ready to provide work in a continuous manor

wants to define everything up front and walk away

want everything 'right first time' no culture of incremental improvement

separate product, architecture dev, QA and Ops functions

Convoluted CR process

Team measured in terms of volume of code delivered/hours spent vs value delivered to customers

Technical debt, code quality are things not understood outside of tech team

## developers aren't ready

Monolithic code base - not split into components

More errors in production

Not disciplined enough to check their work before commmitting

No code reviews/pairing

Work 'given' to developers, rather than team self organising

## QA aren't ready

Caveat that we don't have a QA team at Made

Not many automated tests

A general priciple holds true with CD :Cost of fixing bugs increases exponentially the closer to production those bugs are discovered

QA testing code in staging/continuous - should be involved much earlier ideally writing tests before code is written

Long running automated test suite

No smoke tests/integration tests

## ops aren't ready

Snowflake servers

infrastructure as code

large change windows - lots of manual process

frequent rollbacks

long build times

## external parties aren't ready

external parties on long feedback/change cycles

## customers aren't ready

Customers complain when things change often

don't understand how software is written

don't understand incremental change

not consulted about upcoming changes

no comms channel between tech & customers

## conclusion:
