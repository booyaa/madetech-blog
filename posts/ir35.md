# Choosing The Right Supplier Post IR35 Reform
With the latest reforms to IR35 having come into effect on April 6th, public sector bodies (PSBs) are facing the mounting challenge of keeping teams filled. This, coupled with [the Civil Service-wide recruitment freeze][freeze] introduced in 2010, is a particular problem for PSBs tasked with delivering digital projects, where software engineering teams were once largely made up of contractors who now have an incentive to look elsewhere for work. The reforms are here to stay, so what options do PSBs have in terms of continuing to deliver good digital products?

## The Story So Far
Prior to the IR35 reforms, the recruitment freeze meant that PSBs couldn't take on new employees. However, there weren't such restrictions on bringing in contractors. Hiring an employee means incurring a certain amount of cost and risk, both in terms of onboarding them and hoping that they're a good fit for the organisation in the long term. Contractors don't come with that baggage, in the sense that they're typically not given the same benefits as an employee, and contracts can be as short as a couple of months.

The IR35 reforms came about as a reaction to the increasing number of contractors who were having their contracts continually renewed, to the point that they were essentially full time employees who had the advantage of being able to pay less tax through various means. With IR35, end clients now decide how a long term contractor is taxed. For such contractors, that's not an appealing idea, resulting in many contractors pursuing new work.

## Now what?
PSBs delivering digital products have the unenviable task of figuring out how to get a skilled team working on those products again. The recruitment freeze makes it difficult to bring new people in for the long term, and IR35 means skilled lone contractors will, at best, be around for a matter of a few short months. This leads to high team turnover, and such instability is a danger to software projects - without a consistent driving force leading development, software projects can become unwieldy, difficult to understand and, worse, much more costly to maintain and evolve in the long term.

One option is to bring in dedicated software suppliers.

Notes:
- freelancers can't work in Government for extended periods of time
- cant employ everyone (headcount restriction), cant fire everyone (projects die)
- how to deliver work/be productive with less people?
- government => corporates => contractors
- people in senior positions are contractors => nightmare
