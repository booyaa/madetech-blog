# Good Coder, Better Speaker

My name is Pedro Martin, I have little experience as a programmer. I only began in late April 2015 when I started the course Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

During the course, in addition to classes, we had talks with experts in different areas, some of them were able to express domain concepts in simple words, others not so much, making it very difficult to understand the subject.

However, when listening to experts discuss technology, I have often found that they are less able to express themselves in simple terms. To be good or an  expert in something does not imply that such knowledge can be conveyed in a concise manner.

Before being a programmer I was a Rope Access Technician and before that I was a teacher of Environmental Sciences in secondary schools in Venezuela. Part of my job was to explain in simple words how complex systems rule in natural environments.

One of my inspirations to become a teacher was the late Carl Sagan, for me, he was the perfect example in how to explain complex scientific or technical subjects into little pieces of knowledge.

The following is a practical guide to break down a complex subject in simple pieces of knowledge.

It was first introduce by Karl Ronkhe, one of the founders of [Adventure education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_education).

## APPLE
A facilitation model to make presentation easier.

### Asses:
* Who is the group?
* What they want to accomplish after the talk?
* How long will the program last?
* Where will the program take place?

### Plan:
* How much information do they need?
* How much time do you have?
* What sequence of activities will produce the best results?
* Be prepared to alter your plan on the fly.
* How to bring fun to the lesson?

### Prepare:
* Preparing, different from planning, begins with the implementation.
* Have a plan B if something goes wrong.
* Ensure location has sufficient facilities to accommodate your presentation.

###Lead:
* Set the tone:  make people feel comfortable.
* Style: Be clear and simple, be enthusiastic, use humour.
* Be creative.
* Observe and listen
* Ask questions, check if your audience is with you.
* Have fun.
* Do DADDA (see below).

### Evaluate:
* During the program.
* Monitor the group.

## DDADA
An easy to remember acronym for presenting ideas.

###Describe:
* Present the feature you would like to describe as simple as possible.
* Be creative in your presentation, but do not confuse people with too much detail or jargon.
* Use fantasy and humour when it is appropriate.


### Demonstrate:
Remember *“A picture is worth thousands words”*. No matter how clear your explanation was, a brief demonstration would clarify even more. Like the old chinese proverb *“I hear and I forget, I see it and I remembered, I do, and I understand"*.

### Ask questions:
Before starting a new topic, ask questions to the audience to see if anybody needs clarification. If you don’t ask maybe they would not ask you. If you have many questions, it would be worth it to do the previous two steps. Use your judgment, too many questions can disrupt the flow you would like to achieve.

###Do:
**Play it!**, even if certain people don’t get it at the beginning. If you still notice confused looks, stop, describe or demonstrate again.

###Adapt:
Check if people are having fun, big part of the learning experience is about feelings and emotions, if your audience is having fun, it would improve their learning experience.

These guides are made to give you structure in your presentation. As you are learning and developing your own style you would find out maybe one of the steps is more useful than another. Remember it is only a guide, modify it to suit your needs.

I don't know whether Sagan knew of this process, but if you were to watch the TV series Cosmos, you would find that he uses a similar pattern to explain complex subjects.

I hope you will find this as useful as I did.
