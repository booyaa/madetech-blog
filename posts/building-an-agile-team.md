# Building an agile team

There are many challenges in building an agile team. We hear about self
organising teams but how can a CTO ensure a roadmap is kept? We hear about
\#noestimates but how can we plan anything without estimates? Failure is an
important part of agile but how can we accept failure in production?
Communication is key so how can we encourage it? In this article I will attempt
to address these questions and more.

Delivering great product takes great teams but putting them together is
challenging. It is easy enough to stick a group of people in a room, give them a
list of tasks and ask them to complete them by a date. What is not guaranteed is
that any of the tasks will be completed when you expect.

## Start with a definition

Before we build a team we must first come up with a definition of a team. What
does a team mean to us? Who is it comprised of? What is it's purpose?

Let us just say a team is a group of people brought together for a purpose. It
will be made up of everyone who are required to realise it's purpose. In the
world of software development, teams are brought together to implement new
functionality, to bring improvements to systems and to solve issues.

The purpose of a team is also important. We can define a team's purpose or goal
as something that will be reached within one short iteration. Perhaps two weeks
at most. A team must begin with a goal and end with the delivery of the goal.

We can take this definition a bit further and apply it to building a team.
To build a great team is to engage a group of people around a particular goal
with enough energy to see it through to a conclusion.

## Properties of an agile team

Great agile teams deliver often. They get something out in the wild and respond
to feedback. Agile teams win trust from their successes and recovery from
failure. In order to build a unit that can win trust you must first build a
framework around a team that enables them.

When pulling together teams you are shaping your delivery process. There are
three properties I believe your process should embody:

 - Autonomy
 - Craft
 - Focus

When your process embodies and enshrines these properties you will have yourself
a good foundation on which to deliver.

## Autonomy

Working towards a common goal requires buy in from a team. They need to be
interested enough in working together in order to achieve the desired outcome.
The feeling of responsibility and ownership will strengthen their resolve to
achieve a goal. They must be allowed to make mistakes so that they can learn
from the pain of failure. A team must have permission to solve a problem how
they see fit. This is autonomy.

> more often than not teams thrive with such responsibility

When given to a team, autonomy is powerful in that the responsibility for
delivery is felt strongly. When they can make their own decisions there are
fewer reasons to not deliver, fewer blockers. A software engineering team who
can push their code directly to production as often as they like have no process
to hide behind. When you can QA yourself there is no need to wait for someone
else to check your work and you can therefore move faster. When such barriers
are lifted a team will know that the buck stops with them and more often than
not teams thrive with such responsibility.

Transitioning a team into a self organising structure can take a little bit of
time. Sometimes we find a team isn't used to such responsibility and they can
try to avoid it. Process can be introduced by team members not ready to move so
fast. I've found some teams feature creep or change spec completely
mid-iteration. Such sabotage comes from an engrained sense that work is
continuous, without a start or a finish. Introducing ceremony around delivery
cycles such as showcases where a team presents their work at the end of an
iteration when they reach a milestone can really help a team self organise.
The key is to not allow showcase dates to change so that a team has to explain
to stakeholders at their showcase when they haven't achieved their goal. This
drives them to make changes to avoid the embarrassment in future.

You can find the opposite problem going the other way. Teams used to autonomy
quickly get frustrated quickly at being unable to solve problems themselves.
When deployments of certain applications must be performed by a particular
someone, especially someone outside the team, then those used to being able to
deploy anything will soon be saddened. Same goes for anything from creating
new trello boards to github repos. Teams must be empowered to do all of the
above. A team must have permission to carry out their purpose.

When teams are autonomous they will make mistakes. They'll often make more
mistakes but they'll also be making them faster. Making mistakes early means
the team can learn and adapt. Autonomous teams may be fast to break things but
also fast to fix them. I've heard horror stories of a fast moving autonomous
team having a 2 month deploy freeze on their project after breaking stuff that
they could have fixed in 5 minutes. This is not the way to deal with failure, a
team must have the autonomy to fail and correct such failure.

A team becomes empowered when they can self organise and complete their purpose
with minimal blockers from the outside world. They should be allowed the chance
to show off their agility when making mistakes. Their autonomy will strengthen
their resolve when they feel the responsibility and power to deliver is with
themselves.

## Craftship

A culture of craftship is important to an agile team. A team who are excited
by their ability to solve a problem the way they want will enjoy working towards
a common goal. Practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Delivery
are both indicators of excellence and also improve the ability to achieve a
goal. A team who are excited to discuss their work will be having the
conversations necessary to solve a problem as a team.

When an individual loves their craft they will be excited to solve problems.
A group of excited people solving problems have a collective energy that can be
felt when you walk into the room they occupy. Good signs include seeing two
people sitting at one computer discussing a problem, or perhaps they're standing
by their story board discussing their next task. Positive energy goes a long way
and can keep a team interested and undistracted for longer.

A software team practicing TDD and CD will be exposed to industry best practices
enough to know about these methodologies and more. If they've been practicing
them for a while you may well have yourself an expert team. Expertise within a
team will accelerate the speed at which problems can be solved. It can also help
up skill other members although there will always be a cost to productivity when
expert members divert attention to assisting others.

The buzz in the air when you walk into a teams room is a good sign of healthy
communication. Those excited and caring of their craft will be happy to discuss
their techniques with colleagues who may in turn offer up even better solutions.
If you walk into a room and everyone has their headphones on it's a sign you
may have a problem. You want the communication to be flowing. Of course
communication and craftship aren't the same thing but good communication does
come with good team craftship.

Bringing together a group of people who care for their work is key to achieving
goals. The positive energy from a teams excitement is the fuel to going the extra
mile, to achieving goals more efficiently. With craftship comes best practices
that will help ensure the quality of work delivered. Healthy communication
means problems will be collaboratively with the combined expertise of a team
rather than by siloed individuals. Craftship is a must for solving problems.

## Focus

Bringing a team together to solve a problem is hard. The bigger the goal the
more likely you are not to succeed so you best keep those goals small. A team
built of members who aren't always allocated to that team is sometimes a
necessity but is to be avoided whenever possible as context switching isn't fun.
Same goes to a team working towards multiple goals, context switching isn't fun
so don't do it.

Carefully defining a team's goal is crucial to their success. We find the
smaller the goal the more likely we can accurately predict a completion time.
We also find that smaller goals are easier to put live, affecting a smaller
surface area means there is less risk. Same goes for undiscovered complexity,
the smaller the problem we are solving the less likely it will explode into a
massive piece of work putting out our deadlines.

A common problem we've found working with clients is that team members are often
not committed 100% to a particular team. Often team members will be pulled from
one team to another to help out with a problem. Sometimes team members are
actually committed to both teams. We try and stop this as soon as we can as
it completely breaks focus. We try and ensure goals are broken down enough
that we can finish one goal before switching focus onto another. This means a
team member will be at most busy for a couple of days before being able to
move to another team to provide their expertise.

A similar problem is that of the ronin engineer, a teamless engineer. They are
usually in charge of a piece of technology rather than working within a team.
Service desk type operations is a variant of this where you have a team
dedicated to a technology rather than a team. We try and move these engineers
into a single team, we also try and knowledge share their expertise as soon as
possible so they do not become a blocker for other teams when they are busy.

Teams should have a single goal when they are brought together. A single goal
means they can focus on solving that problem properly before starting another
one. We often setup trello boards per goal and only let a team work from that
board. If other work emerges we ask teams to make note of it and bring it up
in the showcase of their current goal.

Sometimes mid-iteration a goal will change based on some learnings. It may split
into several goals. At this point you cancel the iteration and pull stakeholders
together to share learnings. You can then redefine the goal you want the team
to solve first.

Focus within a team is paramount to getting a problem solved. Just like breaking
big stories down in traditional scrum, goals should be broken down into their
smallest possible incarnation. Team members should be allocated to a single
team and that team to a single goal.

So there you have it: autonomy, craftship and focus. Three properties that will
empower, encourage and endeavour a team to achieve a goal. A team needs to know
they have the power and responsibility to solve a challenge. A team needs to be
excited about their solutions, conversating and learning from each other. A team
needs small focussed goals in order to deliver on time. Go out and conquer!
