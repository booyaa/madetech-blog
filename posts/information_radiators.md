# Information Radiators: A Guide To Getting Started

Agile organisations should favour working in public, over working behind closed doors. 

If you can cultivate an environment which encourages this, and you can get this practice widely adopted within your organisation, then you should see some significant improvements in areas like communications, fewer interruptions and improved transparency.

One of the ways you can encourage public working is by introducing Information Radiators. 

Information Radiators are large, highly visible displays used to share information. They are an extremely effective non-disruptive communication channel and a great mechanism for publicly sharing information. 

### Background
The term Information Radiator was first coined by Alistair Cockburn in 1999. Alistair is one of the founding members of the agile movement, a signator on the Agile Manifesto and author of books such as Agile Software Development. 

### Let's be honest
A good Information Radiator should be honest. Nobody likes to be the bearer of bad news and people (or organisations) often try to ignore problems until they disappear. If you've chosen the right infIt should highlight problems and not hide them away. 

When you walk past an Information Radiator, you should be able to immediately tell if there is a problem. If a system if offline, if your sales figures have dropped or see at a glance whether things are going well, where things are going badly. They should be able to question why things might be going wrong.
