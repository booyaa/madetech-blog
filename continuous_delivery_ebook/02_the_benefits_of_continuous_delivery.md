# The benefits of Continuous Delivery
# The business value

Continuous Delivery is a technique that grew roots in the IT department, but is very much focused on delivering value, in the shape of shipped software, back to the business more frequently and more reliably.

There are a number of reasons we believe organisations should be investing in Continuous Delivery.

We, as most modern software companies, focus on delivering Software as a Service over the Internet. While you're able to realise many of these benefits if you're delivering software via another mechanism such as application installs, there may be some areas where your ability to move at an 'as a Service pace' might be reduced.

## Faster to market

One of the key business drivers we see behind Continuous Delivery adoption, is that it both facilitates and encourages shorter delivery cycles.

Continuous Delivery practitioners must be integrating their work with the rest of the team at least once per day, and ideally, a couple of times an hour.

We've observed Continuous Delivery as the catalyst for improving development practices from inception through to maintenance. The need to keep software release ready encourages, and some corners may argue, demands the adoption of good software engineering practices, such as Test- and Behaviour-Driven Development, Pair Programming, and comprehensive automated testing suites - techniques that we believe, over the course of a software project, will increase your ability to move quickly with confidence.

Continuous Delivery can encourage stakeholders across the organisation to start thinking of software delivery as a series of smaller features. The demands of keeping a single software product release-ready without making use of patterns such as feature branching, are made trickier when delivering particularly big changes.

We see it as a particular value to release many smaller increments, getting features, or subsets of a feature, to market and in the hands of end customers as fast and as often as possible.

## Reduced risk

One of the bigger resistances we find to Continuous Delivery adoption is a common perception that releasing more often is riskier. Often borne from the scars of historical long delivery cycles, where deployments are big scary events containing many large changesets, each one of which has the potential to introduce instability.

By contrast, we see that releasing little and often keep changesets small, and accordingly, the risk of the change introducing issue is reduced.

In addition, by practising deployments more regularly, we become better at them. We're incentivised to replace manual steps with automation, and so the risk associated with human error becomes a less likely occurrence.

Where it allows, our general principal would be to not be overly scared of reasonable production issues at the detriment of moving quickly. Where software is released close to it being built, resolving issues are generally made easier, as memory of the implementation is fresh. Coupled with a fast, automated pipeline allows followup fixes to be released quickly, often squashing issues before they're even noticed.

## Releasing is a business decision

We see too often that releasing software updates is a technology decision, rather than a commercial decision.

Often a process encumbered with risk and a highly orchestrated series of manual steps, each of which offers an opportunity for error, releasing in too many organisations becomes a technically complex routine.

By encouraging discipline within the team to ensure software is perpetually in a release-ready state, the decision to release new features and updates can be moved back to where we believe it belongs: with the commercial stakeholders.

In particularly mature Continuous Delivery environments, an organisation can empower Product Owners to physically push the button to make a release whenever they're happy with the changeset, in a complete absence of operations folk standing by in support.

## Expose inefficiencies

We often find the adoption of Continuous Delivery to be a strong tool in exposing inefficiencies through the software delivery process.

By tightening up discipline and tooling around the build and deployment process, and particularly by focusing on delivering incremental release-ready features, the true barriers preventing an organisation from moving fast are highlighted with a big red pen.

In many we cases we see that outdated technology practices can be a strong force in preventing software being delivered in an acceptable or ideal timeframe for an organisation. However, as more business realise that they're software companies whether they like it or not, there are many factors outside of actually building the software that can be holding businesses back. By getting the software delivery piece right, an organisation loses the most obvious reason for slow software delivery, allowing it to focus on fixing wider issues.
