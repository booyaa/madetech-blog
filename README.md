# Inbound Marketing Plan

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers. ([See Customer Persona document](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing))

Moving forwards, weâ€™re going to make a concerted effort to ensure the blog align closely with our positioning and we will be using this repository to gather our posts.

Everyone is encouraged to contribute ideas to this document and add links through to the relevant posts, once they have been written.
