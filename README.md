# Made Tech Blog

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers.

One of ours aims is to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning, and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers, especially those who fall into the various [customer personas](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing) we would like to target.

## Blog Teams

Everyone will be assigned to one of four houses, whose current members are:

**Stark:** Rory, Nick, Emile

**Baratheon:** Scott, Alex, Luke

**Targaryen:** David, Andrew, Richard

**Lannister:** Fareed, Seb, Chris

Over the course of twelve weeks, each team will be competing to score the most Made Merits for blogging, which will be awarded like so:

- Everyone will be given an individual deadline for their post. Everyone that gets their post in by the deadline will be given 50 Made Merits. Miss a deadline, you forfeit the points.

- For particularly popular posts, an extra 25 Made Merits per 500 views are awarded, regardless of whether your deadline was missed.

We'll have a leaderboard up in the office with current totals and, for those teams working on site, we'll post the totals in Slack daily.

**At the end of each twelve week period, the team who have accrued the most Made Merits can take an Uber from the office to celebrate their victory with dinner and cocktails at a restaurant of their choice (Seb heartily recommends [this one](http://www.bobbobricard.com/), which has a champagne button). Plus ones also welcome.**

Teams are encouraged to self organise; how you decide to get posts written is up to you (#blogHour is still available). If you're struggling to get a post written on time, communicate with your team mates to figure out how best to meet your various deadlines. It's also up to you when you decide to go for your victory dinner.

Deadlines are listed here: https://trello.com/b/jDROwI93/editorial-calendar/calendar/2016/03

Finally, every six weeks, the entire company will meet for a blogging showcase, where everyone will announce their next post, and we'll discuss what worked and what didn't work in the previous six weeks worth of posts.

## How to blog

Once you've settled on an idea, clone this repo and write a blog post on a topic of your choosing. When you're finished, create a pull request and get it reviewed. You should be aiming to have this first draft completed a week before your deadline, to give your colleagues the time to review it for you.

Resolve any issues that have been raised in the review (poke and nag other people to make comments on your post in good time), and update your pull request.
