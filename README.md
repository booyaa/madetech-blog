# Made Tech Blog
This is the place for Made's blogging needs. In this repo you'll find [why we're blogging](#why-are-we-blogging). You can also find some blog post
[ideas](INDEX.md) and our [critical checklist](#checklist).

## Why are we blogging?

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers. ([See Customer Persona document](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing))

We're going to continue investing time in our blog and would like to make a concerted effort to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers.

Moving fowards, we will be using this repository to collate the posts and to solicit feedback from the team. **Everyone** is encouraged to contribute to this document. I've included a few categories and blog posts ideas below. The introduction text for the categories is suggestions on what we could include on the landing pages (as will be good for SEO) and the blog posts are initial ideas, that we should expand upon.

## How to blog

Clone this repo and write your blog post on a topic of your choosing. Once written, create a pull request and get it reviewed. You should be aiming to have this first draft completed a week before your deadline. Once it's been reviewed (poke and nag other people to make comments on your post in good time), resolve any issues that have been raised and update your pull request.

**If you don't submit your completed blog post in a pull request by Friday lunchtime you'll incur the sauerkraut & no beer forfeit.**

## Loopholes

There are none. Even if you find one, it's just your imagination, and it'll vanish as soon as you ask anyone about it.

This allows us to see what posts need marketing, tweeting, etc.

### Popular traffic sources

Historically, sharing a link to a post on sites like Reddit and RubyFlow has resulted in a huge spike in traffic on our site, so it's important we all take responsibility for our own posts and share them each time they're published.

Below is a list of popular traffic sources we should be sharing those links on. It's by no means exhaustive, and not all of them are relevant to every type of post, so do share the link anywhere else you think may be appropriate.
