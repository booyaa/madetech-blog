# Made Tech Blog

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers.

One of ours aims is to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning, and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers, especially those who fall into the various [customer personas](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing) we would like to target.

Moving fowards, we will be using this repository to collate the posts and to solicit feedback from the team. **Everyone** is encouraged to contribute to [this list](INDEX.md) of topics we should be writing about.

## How to blog

Once you've settled on an idea, clone this repo and write a blog post on a topic of your choosing. When you're finished, create a pull request and get it reviewed. You should be aiming to have this first draft completed a week before your deadline, to give your colleagues the time to review it for you.

Resolve any issues that have been raised in the review (poke and nag other people to make comments on your post in good time), and update your pull request.
