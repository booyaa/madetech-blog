# Inbound Marketing Plan

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers. ([See Customer Persona document](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing))

We're going to continue investing time in our blog and would like to make a concerted effort to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers.

Moving fowards, we will be using this repository to collate the posts and to solicit feedback from the team. **Everyone** is encouraged to contribute new topic ideas to this document. I've included a few categories and blog posts ideas below, though we should expand upon these.

### Instructions
To create a blog post, fork the repository and write about your chosen topic. Once you've written a post, issue a pull request to the team. *You'll need to have issued the pull request by Friday lunchtime to avoid the Sauerkraut penalty*

Once you've written a post, make sure you link through to it from this document, so nobody writes about the same thing.
