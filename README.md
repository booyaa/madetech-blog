# Made Tech Blog

You've found the place for your Made blogging needs. In the repo you can find
some of the [whys to our blogging](#why-are-we-blogging). You can also find some
[ideas](INDEX.md) and our [critical checklist](#checklist).

## Why are we blogging?

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers. ([See Customer Persona document](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing))

We're going to continue investing time in our blog and would like to make a concerted effort to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers.

Moving fowards, we will be using this repository to collate the posts and to solicit feedback from the team. **Everyone** is encouraged to contribute to this document. I've included a few categories and blog posts ideas below. The introduction text for the categories is suggestions on what we could include on the landing pages (as will be good for SEO) and the blog posts are initial ideas, that we should expand upon.

## How to blog

Creating a blog post is easy. You clone this repo and write your blog post on
your chosen topic. Once written create a pull request and get it reviewed.
Then post it and share it online.

**If you don't submit you blog post in a pull request by Friday lunchtime you'll
be eating your sauerkraut forfeit.**

### Popular traffic sources

Historically, sharing a link to a post on sites like Reddit and RubyFlow has resulted in a huge spike in traffic on our site, so it's important we all take responsibility for our own posts and share them each time they're published.

Below is a list of popular traffic sources we should be sharing those links on. It's by no means exhaustive, and not all of them are relevant to every type of post, so do share the link anywhere else you think may be appropriate.
