# Inbound Marketing Plan

Our company blog is a critical channel for inbound marketing efforts, lead generation & brand awareness. It builds credibility through thought leadership and helps to build trust and relationships with our customers. ([See Customer Persona document](https://docs.google.com/a/maine-associates.com/document/d/1S0VF2oMMGqyHByisSmGDMGpZgTUcuh-38J9rg6GpcEQ/edit?usp=sharing))

We're going to continue investing time in our blog and would like to make a concerted effort to ensure our blog posts closely align with our positioning and provides interesting and thought provoking reading to our customers.

Moving fowards, we will be using this repository to collate the posts and to solicit feedback from the team. **Everyone** is encouraged to contribute to this document. I've included a few categories and blog posts ideas below. The introduction text for the categories is suggestions on what we could include on the landing pages (as will be good for SEO) and the blog posts are initial ideas, that we should expand upon.

### Instructions
To create a blog post, fork the repository and write about your chosen topic. Once you've written a post, issue a pull request to the team. **You'll need to have issued the pull request by Friday lunchtime to avoid the Sauerkraut penalty**

Once you've written a post, make sure you link through to it from this document, so nobody writes about the same thing.

#### Post Publish Checklist
Historically, sharing a link to a post on sites like Reddit and RubyFlow has resulted in a huge spike in traffic on our site, so it's important we all take responsibility for our own posts and share them each time they're published.

Below is a list of popular traffic sources we should be sharing those links on. It's by no means exhaustive, and not all of them are relevant to every type of post, so do share the link anywhere else you think may be appropriate.

- [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com)
- [/r/programming (627,812 readers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming)
- [/r/ruby (29,716 readers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby)
- [/r/rails (14,851 readers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/rails)
- [/r/agile (3,322 readers)](http://www.reddit.com/r/agile)

- [DZone](https://dzone.com/links)
- [Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/)
- [Bootstrappers](http://www.bootstrappers.io/)

Some additional things we should be doing include:

- Retweeting the [MadeTech](https://twitter.com/madetech_com) tweets regarding the post as Seb sends them out.
- Liking/sharing the [company Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/madetech) post.
