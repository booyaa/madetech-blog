My name is Pedro Martin, I have little experience as a programmer. I began only in late April 2015 when I started the course Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

During the course in addition to classes, we had talks with experts in different areas, some of them were really good exposing in simple words their domain area, others not so much, making it very difficult to understand the subject.

This situation, where experts did not express in simple words their domain areas I have found it very often in discussions about technology. To be good or an  expert in something does not imply that such knowledge can be transmitted in simple words.

Before being programmer I was Rope Access Technician and before that I was teacher of Environmental Science in secondary schools. Part of my job was to explain in simple words how complex systems rules in the natural environment.

The following is a practical guide to break down a complex subject in simple pieces of knowledge.

I was made it by Karl Ronkhe, one of the founders of [Adventure education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_education).

## APPLE
A facilitation model to make easy a presentation.

### Asess:
* Who is the group?
* What they want to accomplish after the talk?
* How long will the program last?
* Where will the program take place?

### Plan:
* How much information do they need?
* How much time do you have?
* What sequence of activities will produce the best results?
* Be prepare to alter your plan on the fly.
* How to bring fun to the lesson?

### Prepare:
* Preparing, different from planning, begins with the implementation .
* Have a plan B if something goes wrong.
* Check location.

###Lead:
* Set a tone:  make people feel comfortable.
* Style: Be clear and simple, be enthusiastic, use humour.
* Be creative.
* Observe and listen
* Ask questions, check if your audience is with you.
* Have fun.
* Do DADDA (see below).

### Evaluate:
* During the program.
* Monitor the group.

## DADDA
An easy to remember acronym for presenting pieces of knowledge content.

###Describe:
* Present the the feature you would like to describe as simple as possible.
* Be creative in your presentation, but not confuse people with too much detail.
* Use fantasy and humour when is appropriated.


### Demonstrate:
Remember *“A picture is worth thousands words”*. No matter how clear was your explanation, a brief demonstration would clarify even more. Like the old chases proverb *“I hear and I forget, I see it and I remembered, I do, and I understand"*.

### Ask questions:
Before starting a new topic, ask questions to the audience to see if anybody needs clarification. If you don’t ask maybe they not ask you. If you have many questions, be worth it to do the previous two steps. Use your judgment, too many questions can disrupt the flow you would like to achieve.

###Do:
**Play it!**, even if certain people don’t get it at the beginning. If you still noticed confused looks, stop, describe or demonstrate again.

###Adapt:
Check if people are having fun, big part of the learning experience is about feelings and emotions, if your audience is having fun would improve their learning experience.

These guides are made to give  you structure in your presentation. As you are learning and developing your own style you would find out maybe one of the steps is more useful than another. Remember is only a guide, modify as best as suit you.

I hope you would find useful as I did.
